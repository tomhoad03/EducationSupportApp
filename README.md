# COMP6239-Education-Support-App

This project will produce an app as part of a COMP6239 Mobile Application Development group coursework. This should represent an Educator/Learner system, in which Educators create courses with tests and assign learners/students to them. They could also track different metrics of the learners. The learners could attend courses and carry out tests. They could see how well they've done.
